This is just for POC purposes to give a shot on how to create custom connector for LookerStudio while also protecting the generated URL to be accessed by public.

## Running the Connector

In order to test this particular custom connector, please upload `code.gs` along with its manifest (`appsscript.json`) to [LookerStudio](https://lookerstudio.google.com).
